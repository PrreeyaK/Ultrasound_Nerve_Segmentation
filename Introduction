Why this project is useful for society?

Even the bravest patient cringes at the mention of a surgical procedure. Surgery inevitably brings discomfort, and oftentimes involves significant post-surgical pain. Currently, patient pain is frequently managed through the use of narcotics that bring a bevy of unwanted side effects.

In this project we are working to improve pain management through the use of indwelling catheters that block or mitigate pain at the source. Pain management catheters reduce dependence on narcotics and speed up patient recovery.

Accurately identifying nerve structures in ultrasound images is a critical step in effectively inserting a patientâ€™s pain management catheter. In this competition, Kagglers are challenged to build a model that can identify nerve structures in a dataset of ultrasound images of the neck. Doing so would improve catheter placement and contribute to a more pain free future.
